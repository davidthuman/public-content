Nothing in life is 100%, 1, or perfectly full. This can be proven in a quantum mechanical standpoint or through the semantics of classification. The idea of approaching the asymptote fills this gap and allows us to proceed normally with our life.

Some people would say that there is no such thing as a Utopia, these people would be right. So is there no point of attempting to get there if the end goal is impossible to achieve? Using the framework of the asymptote, there is a path, maybe not so clear, to approach this goal of a great society.

What is the purpose of Man?

Well, it is to make each other happy, to given yourself and everyone around you the best live they can have. Truly in this great cosmos are we just a speck of dust, the only thing we will ever carry with us to the end is the grappling we did with life. Life is the only thing we have, every other thing is but a subclass to its larger parent, so why not make it the best life ever? Why not indulge in the joyess things that life has to offer. And no, this does not mean to toss the existents of others out the window and to get as high as possible, we do get enjoyment from helping others and you are therefore making their human goals closer.

As I explore and meet new people, I have developed somewhat of an inclination that, genetically, there are only a few or maximum several types of people. I believe the large amount of variation comes from the environment, which paired up with the genetic factor of the person, creates their overall personality. I cannot support this inclination with number or fact, but it is just a feeling I get when I meet and attempt to classify a new person in my life, and a piss-ant life at that.

It comes to me now that I think I am scare, dishearten by, or reluctant to like or love romantically with a women.
